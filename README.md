STEP-6: Run Diagnostic Tools Use built-in diagnostic tools provided by the operating system to identify hardware or software problems.

STEP-7: Review Event Logs Check the system logs for error messages or warnings that might provide clues about the issue. In Windows, you can use the Event Viewer; in Linux, check syslog or journalctl.

STEP-8: Remove Recently Installed Software If the problem started after installing new software, consider uninstalling it to see if that resolves the issue.

STEP-9: Safe Mode Boot the system into safe mode to check if the problem persists. Safe mode loads the OS with minimal drivers and can help identify if third-party software is causing the issue.

STEP-11: Check Disk and File System Use built-in utilities like chkdsk (Windows) or fsck (Linux) to scan and repair disk errors and file system issues

STEP-12: Update Drivers Ensure that your hardware drivers (graphics, sound, network) are up to date. Outdated drivers can cause various problems.

STEP-13: Restore the System If applicable, consider using system restore points to revert your system to a previous state when it was working correctly.
